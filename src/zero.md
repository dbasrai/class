# Purpose

The purpose of this class is to build a 5-minute set, which is the ticket to perform at any open mic. The class is comprised of 8 lessons that will provide ideas and exercises to guide crafting these 5 minutes. The first 4 lessons are built around generating the intial 5 minutes, and the last 4 lessons are built around performing it and refining it. 

In practicality, this is quite an inefficient way to start stand-up. I think nothing in this book will be as useful as sitting down a weekend, banging out ~5 minutes of jokes, then going to an open mic and performing it. I think this book is best used as a companion piece for someone writing jokes and performing them at open mics regularly, to be perused for some perspectives, writing prompts, and links to good bits that can hopefully jog some idaes.

Regardless of whether you're faithfully following this week by week or you're a working comic looking for something in here that'll make you mad, welcome!
