# About

My name is Diya Basrai, I'm a Chicago-based comic and I teach an intro to stand-up class at Revival Theater. This is mainly written as the companion to the class, documenting activities, assignments, and links. 

I also have written this to be generally useful to people starting comedy. Concretely some of the info in "Basics" section, such as "Etiquette," or "How To Open Mic" tries to articulate some rules that are usually only explained when accidentally violated. I've also tried to sprinkle in some of my thoughts and perspectives about the best way to approach starting stand-up. 

The main class is set-up to build a tight five minute set. Most of the advice is about buliding a strong showcase set (<=10 min set time). All bits and sets in this course are extracted from similar length sets, mostly ~5-min late night sets and ~8-min Don't Tell sets. 

# Layout

The numbered weeks correspond to each week's class in an 8-week class. The Basics page contains useful advice for new comics, such as terminology and guides for entering a scene. The Chicago Resources page contains useful links for Chicago comics
