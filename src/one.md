# Hey, Be Yourself Up There

For me, the person who I'd want to make laugh the hardest is myself the day before I started doing stand-up. Over the years, technical knowledge, hours and hours of stand-up consumption, and a good amount of bitterness and jealousy have permanently altered what I find funny. I think this is present in all artforms, that as you gain the competence to do it, you perhaps lose your naive taste and appreciation for it.

This lesson 
## Assignment

Get your notebook. Choose your routine. Make everything bleed you. Have an outfit you think defines you. If you think people who dress nicely are stupid, then wear a stupid sclubby outfit. Everything is you, no one will tell you what to do. 

By the way, none of us know who you are. If you want to be something else, just lie from now on. We will never know. 

## Activity

Remember a moment you felt funny. It can be somethting said to a friend, something typed onto a work Microsoft Teams chat, something said to yourself while you were stoned at home. 

Think about why it was funny. Was it a clever line? Was it funny because it was just the perfect line for the context? Was it funny because you're normally quiet? Etc.

Write it down.
